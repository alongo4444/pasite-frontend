# Frontend Of Pseudomonas AeruginoSite 

This bioinformatics development project provides a platform for mining defense systems of the bacteria Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, via a user-friendly web application. Due to the vast amount of information that exists, lack of Pseudomonas Aeruginosa-specialized interface, and no tools to research defense systems and phenotypic or genomic correlation - the need for a cross-referenced information platform arose.
This project revolves around defense systems of Pseudomonas Aeruginosa and provides information regarding ~18 different defense systems in ~6000 strains, each of their ~6000 genes, and ~50,000 gene clusters of the bacteria. The project would enable researchers to explore defense systems of bacterial species and to better understand their association with genomic, environmental, and phenotypic traits.
The application provides a variety of displays and visualization tools that helps researchers to get insights by a few clicks, among them:
1.	Interactive tabular display of genes of the desired strains. 
2.	Interactive Circos Genome Browser of a desired strain genome and information about the genes associated with specific defense systems.
3.	Circular Phylogenetic Tree with the distribution of desired associated data (i.e. defense systems, meta-data and more).
4.	Correlation tests between any pair from of the following groups: defense systems, cluster, strain and genes attributes (i.e. genome size and more) and meta-data.
5.	Download any data from the system’s database for personal use.
The goal of this project is to supply researchers and the scientific community with a web interface to consume, map, and visualize the rather complex information on Pseudomonas Aeruginosa.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
